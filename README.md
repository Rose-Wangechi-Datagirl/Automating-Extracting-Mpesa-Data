## Filter data from your Mpesa statement in seconds

Have you ever wanted to filter out specific data from Mpesa, but didn't have the patience to go through a ton of Mpesa messages on your phone?

When testing an app during development, you have to perform quality assurance based on real-life situations. If the app involves Mpesa transactions, you actually have to make real transactions. Don't worry, you don't use your own money, but the company's resources. The catch is, the company will want proof in the form of a detailed Excel sheet showing how you used the QA money. Copying and pasting transaction details like transaction codes, amounts, dates, and other information from text to Excel every month can be a real pain, especially when there are hundreds of transactions.

To make my life easier and save time, I wrote a Python script to help me filter out the necessary details over a specific time period. Finally, you can save the data as an Excel sheet on your computer.
